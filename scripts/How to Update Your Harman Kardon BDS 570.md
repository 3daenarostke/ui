The Harman Kardon BDS 570 is not just a Blu-ray player, but also a receiver that can handle various audio and video sources. It supports 3D playback, Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio decoding, and HDMI 1.4 with Audio Return Channel. It also has a USB port that can play music, photos, and videos from external devices[^1^].
 
One of the main features of the BDS 570 is its sleek and minimalist design. It has a glossy black finish and a touch-sensitive control panel that lights up when in use. The display is clear and easy to read, and the remote control is ergonomic and intuitive[^1^]. The BDS 570 can also be controlled by an iOS or Android app via Bluetooth[^3^].
 
The BDS 570 delivers a brilliant sound and great picture quality, thanks to its high-quality components and processing. It can handle Blu-ray discs with ease, producing sharp and detailed images with accurate colors and smooth motion. It can also upscale DVDs to near-HD quality[^1^]. The sound quality is equally impressive, using generous scale and considerable agility to create a realistic and immersive surround sound experience. The dialogue is clear and balanced, and the effects are dynamic and powerful[^1^].
 
However, the BDS 570 is not without its drawbacks. One of the main limitations is the lack of streaming features. The BDS 570 does not have Wi-Fi or Ethernet connectivity, which means it cannot access online content or services such as Netflix, YouTube, or Spotify. It also does not support DLNA or AirPlay, which means it cannot stream music or videos from other devices on your home network[^1^]. This is a significant disadvantage compared to some of its competitors, especially in this age of smart TVs and media players.
 
Another issue is the limited input options. The BDS 570 only has three HDMI inputs, which may not be enough for some users who have multiple devices to connect. It also does not have any analogue audio inputs, which means it cannot connect to older sources such as CD players or turntables[^1^]. Furthermore, it does not have any pre-outs or zone outputs, which means it cannot expand to a 7.1-channel system or power speakers in another room[^3^].
 
The Harman Kardon BDS 570 is a compact and convenient home cinema system that offers great sound quality and connectivity. However, it also lacks some features that are common in other products in its price range, such as streaming capabilities and input flexibility. If you are looking for a simple and stylish solution for your home theater needs, the BDS 570 could be perfect for you. But if you want more functionality and versatility, you may want to consider other options.
